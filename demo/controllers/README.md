# Running the Faber-Alice Demo with an External Controller

To run with the Node controllers, execute the ```run_demo.sh``` script in the node folder.  This script builds and starts 2 instances of the cloud agent and 2 instances of the node controller.  It also registers the controller webhooks with the agent.

The Postman calls to initiate the connection are in the file ```INDY.postman_collection.json```.
